  CSV containing subnational p-codes, their corresponding administrative names, parent p-codes, and reference dates for the world (where available). These are constructed using the COD gazetteers.

  English names are used where available, followed by names written in Latin alphabets.

  Note that Indonesia admin4 is not included for now, as that data is contained in a second, non-standard gazetteer.
